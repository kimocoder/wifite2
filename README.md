Wifite
======

This repo is a complete re-write of [`wifite`](https://github.com/derv82/wifite), a Python script for auditing wireless networks.

Wifite runs existing wireless-auditing tools for you. Stop memorizing command arguments & switches!

Wifite is designed to use all known methods for retrieving the password of a wireless access point (router).  These methods include:
1. WPS: The [Offline Pixie-Dust attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi-Fi_Protected_Setup#Offline_brute-force_attack)
1. WPS: The [Online Brute-Force PIN attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi-Fi_Protected_Setup#Online_brute-force_attack)<br>
   WPS: The [Offline NULL PIN attack](https://github.com/t6x/reaver-wps-fork-t6x/wiki/Introducing-a-new-way-to-crack-WPS:-Option--p-with-an-Arbitrary-String)
2. WPA: The [WPA Handshake Capture](https://hashcat.net/forum/thread-7717.html) + offline crack.
3. WPA: The [PMKID Hash Capture](https://hashcat.net/forum/thread-7717.html) + offline crack.
4. WEP: Various known attacks against WEP, including *fragmentation*, *chop-chop*, *aireplay*, etc.
5. WIFI Signal jammer, block specific accesspoints or multiple.
   signal jamming only works for specific Atheros WiFi chipsets. 

Run wifite, select your targets, and Wifite will automatically start trying to capture or crack the password.

Required Tools
--------------
First and foremost, you will need a wireless card capable of "Monitor Mode" and packet injection (see [this tutorial for checking if your wireless card is compatible](https://www.aircrack-ng.org/doku.php?id=compatible_cards) and also [this guide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi-Fi_Protected_Setup#Offline_brute-force_attack)). There are many cheap wireless cards that plug into USB available from online stores.

Second, only the latest versions of these programs are supported and must be installed for Wifite to work properly:

**Required:**

* Suggest using `python3` as `python2` was marked deprecated as of january 2020.
* As we moved from older python and changed to fully support and run on `python3.11`
* [`Iw`](https://wireless.wiki.kernel.org/en/users/documentation/iw): For identifying wireless devices already in Monitor Mode.
* [`Ip`](https://packages.debian.org/buster/net-tools): For starting/stopping wireless devices.
* [`Aircrack-ng`](https://aircrack-ng.org/) suite, includes:
   * [`airmon-ng`](https://tools.kali.org/wireless-attacks/airmon-ng): For enumerating and enabling Monitor Mode on wireless devices.
   * [`aircrack-ng`](https://tools.kali.org/wireless-attacks/aircrack-ng): For cracking WEP .cap files and WPA handshake captures.
   * [`aireplay-ng`](https://tools.kali.org/wireless-attacks/aireplay-ng): For deauthing access points, replaying capture files, various WEP attacks.
   * [`airodump-ng`](https://tools.kali.org/wireless-attacks/airodump-ng): For target scanning & capture file generation.
   * [`packetforge-ng`](https://tools.kali.org/wireless-attacks/packetforge-ng): For forging capture files.

**Optional, but Recommended:**

* [`tshark`](https://www.wireshark.org/docs/man-pages/tshark.html): For detecting WPS networks and inspecting handshake capture files.
* [`reaver`](https://github.com/t6x/reaver-wps-fork-t6x): For WPS Pixie-Dust & brute-force attacks.
   * Note: Reaver's `wash` tool can be used to detect WPS networks if `tshark` is not found.
* [`bully`](https://github.com/aanarchyy/bully): For WPS Pixie-Dust & brute-force attacks.
   * Alternative to Reaver. Specify `--bully` to use Bully instead of Reaver.
   * Bully is also used to fetch PSK if `reaver` cannot after cracking WPS PIN.
* [`john`](https://www.openwall.com/john): For CPU (OpenCL)/GPU cracking passwords fast.
* [`coWPAtty`](https://tools.kali.org/wireless-attacks/cowpatty): For detecting handshake captures.
* [`hashcat`](https://hashcat.net/): For cracking PMKID hashes.
   * [`hcxdumptool`](https://github.com/ZerBea/hcxdumptool): For capturing PMKID hashes.
   * [`hcxpcapngtool`](https://github.com/ZerBea/hcxtools): For converting PMKID packet captures into `hashcat`'s format.
* [`macchanger`](https://github.com/alobbs/macchanger): For randomizing MAC addresses to avoid detection and improve anonymity.
* [`pixiewps`](https://github.com/wiire-a/pixiewps): For WPS Pixie-Dust attacks (alternative implementation).

**üí° TIP:** Use `wifite -h -v` to see all available options and advanced settings!

Performance Tips
-----------------

### For Best Results
* **Use a dedicated wireless adapter** - USB adapters often perform better than built-in cards
* **Position matters** - Get closer to target networks for better signal strength
* **Choose the right channel** - Use `-c <channel>` to focus on specific channels
* **Limit concurrent attacks** - Use `--first 5` to attack only the strongest targets first

### Speed Optimization
* **PMKID first** - Try `--pmkid-only` for fastest WPA/WPA2 attacks (no clients needed)
* **Skip WPS on modern routers** - Use `--no-wps` on newer routers that likely have WPS disabled
* **Use wordlists efficiently** - Start with common passwords, use `--dict <wordlist>`

### Resource Management
* **Monitor system resources** - Watch CPU and memory usage during long scans
* **Regular breaks** - Stop and restart wifite periodically during extended sessions
* **Clean up** - Remove old capture files and temporary data regularly

### Core Features
* **Less bugs**
   * Cleaner process management. Does not leave processes running in the background (the old `wifite` was bad about this).
   * No longer "one monolithic script". Has working unit tests. Pull requests are less-painful!
* **Speed**
   * Target access points are refreshed every second instead of every 5 seconds.
* **Accuracy**
   * Displays realtime Power level of currently-attacked target.
   * Displays more information during an attack (e.g. % during WEP chopchop attacks, Pixie-Dust step index, etc)
* **Educational**
   * The `--verbose` option (expandable to `-vv` or `-vvv`) shows which commands are executed & the output of those commands.
   * This can help debug why Wifite is not working for you. Or so you can learn how these tools are used.
* More-actively developed, with some help from the awesome open-source community.
* Python 3 support.
* Sweet new ASCII banner.


Troubleshooting
---------------

### Common Issues

**"Too many open files" error:**
- This has been fixed in v2.7.3 with enhanced process management
- If you still encounter this, try reducing concurrent attacks or restart wifite

**Permission denied errors:**
- Ensure you're running wifite with `sudo`
- Check that your wireless interface supports monitor mode
- Verify all required tools are installed and accessible

**Interface not found:**
- Run `sudo airmon-ng` to see available interfaces
- Use `sudo airmon-ng start <interface>` to enable monitor mode manually
- Some interfaces require specific drivers or firmware

**WPS attacks failing:**
- Ensure `reaver` and/or `bully` are installed and up-to-date
- Some routers have WPS disabled or rate-limiting enabled
- Try the `--pixie` flag for Pixie-Dust attacks specifically

**Handshake capture issues:**
- Ensure clients are connected to the target network
- Use `--deauth-count` to increase deauth attempts
- Some networks may require longer capture times

### Getting Help

1. **Enable verbose mode:** Use `-v`, `-vv`, or `-vvv` to see detailed command output
2. **Check dependencies:** Run `wifite --help` to see if all tools are detected
3. **Update tools:** Ensure you have the latest versions of aircrack-ng, hashcat, etc.
4. **Check compatibility:** Verify your wireless card supports monitor mode and injection
